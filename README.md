# Don't Die Community Documentation Site

This site is hosted on GitHub Pages and built with Docusaurus framework/tooling. Get stuck in, make changes and raise pull requests!

To run and test changes locally: `npm run start`

To deploy to github pages: `yarn deploy` (Only Dave can do this at the moment)

# What is XP?

XP (Experience Points) are generated through the completion of daily quests. Click on your Daily Score and go to the `Quests` tab to see how many you have completed and to see your current XP level. Quests are automatically completed as you achieve them.

Does XP do anything? At the moment no (as of February 2025), but there is very likely to be utility in the future.
